PARCEL HACK 2019 DATA DICTIONARY
2 csvs have been provided for you. The first csv, "parcelhack_jobs.csv", represents the data for roughly 9000 a to b deliveries, which we call "jobs". The second csv, "parcelhack_courier_pings.csv", represents the "pings" (or locations) that were sent from the courier's mobile phone whilst they were performing the job. Please note the second dataset is too large to be opened in Excel.
Both csvs makes use of Uber's H3 library, which divides the surface of the earth into recursive hexagons. You can watch a video about tiling the earth with hexagons here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay2uwtRO3QE&t=18s.
